# Crop-Disease-App

This application allows users to classify plant diseases by uploading images of plant leaves. It utilizes a deep learning model trained on various plant disease datasets to accurately predict the disease affecting the plant. The app also provides detailed care and treatment solutions for the detected diseases, ensuring that farmers can take prompt action to protect their crops. 

### Key Features:
- **Disease Classification:** The app allows users to upload images of plant leaves, which are analyzed using a deep learning model. The model can identify various plant diseases and provide corresponding solutions, helping farmers manage disease outbreaks effectively.
- **Multi-language Support:** The app is accessible in multiple languages, including **English, Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam**, making it usable for a broad audience across different regions.
- **Care and Treatment Solutions:** Once a disease is detected, the app provides detailed information on how to care for the affected plants and suggested treatments. This information is aimed at helping farmers take immediate action to protect their crops.

### Additional Features:
- **Chatbot for Farmers:** The app includes a chatbot designed to assist farmers with their agricultural needs. The chatbot can provide advice, answer queries related to crop diseases, farming techniques, and general agricultural practices. Itâ€™s a user-friendly tool to help farmers stay informed and receive timely advice for their specific queries. 
- **Image to Text Conversion:** This feature allows users to convert text from images (e.g., leaf damage descriptions, handwritten notes, or crop labels) into editable digital text. This makes it easier for farmers and agricultural workers to digitize written content, keep records, or share information seamlessly.

These new features, combined with the disease classification capabilities, make the app a powerful tool for improving farm management, boosting productivity, and ensuring better crop health.
